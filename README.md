> **Abstract** *Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs. Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes α-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of assistant distributions, and α-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The α-mixture assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable α, which has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant distribution space.*


## Environment
Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the `install.sh` file:
```
bash install.sh
```


## Datasets
- The training/evaluation intruction-response data before processing can be downloaded from [MiniLLM](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm).
```
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/dolly --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/dolly/
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/self-inst --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/self-inst/
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/Vicuna --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/vicuna/
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/sinst --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/sinst/
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/uinst --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/uinst/
```

- The processed data can be downloaded from [MiniLLM](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm). 
```
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/dolly-processed --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./processed_data/dolly/
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/openwebtext-processed --repo-type=dataset --local-dir ./processed_data/openwebtext/gpt2/512/10M/
```


## Models
To run fine-tuning or standard KD baselines, you need to download the model checkpoints from [Huggingface Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and put them in `checkpoints/`. For example, for gpt2-large, you can download the model from this [link](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large/tree/main) and put them in `checkpoints/gpt2-large`.
```
huggingface-cli download gpt2 --repo-type model --local-dir ./checkpoints/gpt2-base
huggingface-cli download gpt2-medium --repo-type model --local-dir ./checkpoints/gpt2-medium
huggingface-cli download gpt2-large --repo-type model --local-dir ./checkpoints/gpt2-large
huggingface-cli download gpt2-xl --repo-type model --local-dir ./checkpoints/gpt2-xlarge
```

## Usage
The main hyperparameters of AMiD are as follows: 
- `amid-div-name` : Name of divergence
- `amid-div-order` : Order of distributions in divergence
- `amid-alpha` : Value of alpha
- `amid-lam` : Value of lambda

Detailed values for these hyperparameters can be found in our paper. Please refer to the provided bash scripts for detailed arguments when running experiments.


## Train
We provide example commands for `gpt2-base`. Please refer to `scripts` for other model architectures. The final checkpoints are selected by the **ROUGE-L** scores. Please refer to [MiniLLM](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/blob/main/minillm/README.md), [DistiLLM](https://github.com/jongwooko/distillm), and [ABKD](https://github.com/ghwang-s/abkd) for instructions on how to run baselines. 

#### Fine-tune the teacher models
```
bash ./scripts/gpt2/sft/sft_xlarge.sh ${/PATH/TO/AMiD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

or download from [MiniLLM](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm).

```
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/teacher-gpt2-1.5B --repo-type model --local-dir ./results/gpt2/train/sft/gpt2-xlarge
```

#### Student Initialization
The final checkpoints are selected by the **validation loss**.
```
bash ./scripts/gpt2/init/init_base.sh ${/PATH/TO/AMiD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

or download from [MiniLLM](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm).

```
huggingface-cli download MiniLLM/init-gpt2-120M --repo-type model --local-dir ./results/gpt2/train/init/gpt2-base
